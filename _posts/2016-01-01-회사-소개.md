![CEO]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about.jpg)

### Tae-joon KIM Ph.D

I worked for [KAERI](http://www.kaeri.re.kr:8080/english/) (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute) 30 years, and now I run this company as CEO. I received a doctoral degree in chemical engineering, [Seogang Univ.](http://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/). In KAERI just before, I took the charged serveral research projects and the projects like as large plant construction, and applied for many patents about it in this time. So, now I am developing a High Temperature-Pressure, Level, Flow instruments, and AC or DC Electromagnetic Pumps for industrial applications, which is cheaper and more general.
